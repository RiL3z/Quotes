Sam Harris:
  - "Human well-being is not a random phenomenon. It depends on many factors - ranging from genetics and neurobiology to sociology and economics. But, clearly, there are scientific truths to be known about how we can flourish in this world. Wherever we can have an impact on the well-being of others, questions of morality apply."
  - "As an atheist, I am angry that we live in a society in which the plain truth cannot be spoken without offending 90% of the population."
  - "Many scientists have been drawn to Buddhism out of a sense that the Western tradition has delivered an impoverished conception of basic, human sanity. In the West, if you speak to yourself out loud all day long, you are considered crazy. But speaking to yourself silently - thinking incessantly - is considered perfectly normal."
Richard Dawkins:
  - "By all means let's be open-minded, but not so open-minded that our brains drop out."
Bruce Lee:
  - "Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it."
  - "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times."
  - "A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer."
  - "To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities."
